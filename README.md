## About Me 🏃

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland. I'm majoring in computer science and finance. I've earned an honors citation from the [Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program](http://eip.umd.edu/) and am currently working towards a specialization in data science.

I'm passionate about programming because it's both creative and analytical.

I've worked as a full-stack developer, a researcher in data science labs, and a teaching assistant. I hope to one day integrate my knowledge about machine learning and computer vision technologies with my experience working on large-scale applications to make things that can tangibly improve the lives of ordinary people.   

### What I'm Working On 🔭

I'm currently working to gain a holistic and thorough understanding of data science. I'm also learning as much as I can about the design and analysis of algorithms. 

In the fall I start work in a [Department of Aerospace Engineering](https://aero.umd.edu/) lab where I'll be building this really interesting computer vision application. I can't talk too much about the details at the moment but I'm excited about it.

### My Interests 👨‍💻️

On the technical side of things I'm interested in application development, algorithms, embedded systems, and all things data.

I'm also interested in entrepreneurship, probability, the life sciences (especially neuroscience), philosophy, psychology and reading in general. I'm an avid runner and I'm currently training for a marathon. I enjoy playing poker and chess.
